Git

This is the file I have created for practicing Git.

I have explored various Git commands like how to push, pull and clone.

Command for clone - git clone url (url you need to clone)

Command for checking status - git status

To initiate git - git init

To add file - git add filename

Make commit - git commit -m "Created commit"

For pusing file - git push origin main

To pull - git pull
